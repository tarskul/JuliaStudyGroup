# From Python To Julia

Remark from the original author (Tars Verschelde): I made this Jupyter notebook quickly for myself so it might not be the best learning material you can find but I made it available because it still might be helpful for you too.


The main differences from python to julia are written in the interactive Jupyter Notebook. Check out the project website for more information on Jupyter Notebooks (<https://jupyter.org/>). To get started first download jupyterlab with the following command (assuming you already have python installed):
'''python
pip install jupyterlab
'''
Then open jupyterlab with the commandline or use your own preferred application. My personal favorite:
